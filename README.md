# NPCMakerService

Purpose of the Application

The purpose of my application, the NPC Maker, is to provide authors with a way to invent side characters as quickly and efficiently as possible. The application should allow this to occur with a minimum of interruption in work flow so that the writer may continue working without losing focus.

How This Project Helps

This is the Service layer of the application.
